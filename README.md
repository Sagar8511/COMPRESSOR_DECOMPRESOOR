# COMPRESSOR_DECOMPRESSOR

Project Description:
The "Compressor and Decompressor" project is a minor project implemented in Java that focuses on reducing the number of bits required to represent data through compression techniques. The objective of this project is to explore and implement lossless compression algorithms to achieve efficient data compression without any data loss.

The project primarily aims to harness the benefits of compression, which include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs. By compressing data, we can significantly reduce the size of files or datasets, allowing for more efficient storage and transmission.

One crucial aspect of this project is the emphasis on lossless conversion during compression. Lossless compression techniques ensure that no data is lost during the compression process. This is achieved by encoding the data in such a way that it can be accurately restored to its original form during decompression. As a result, users can be confident that their data remains intact throughout the compression and decompression process.

The project will involve the implementation of various lossless compression algorithms in Java, such as Huffman coding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression, or Run-Length Encoding (RLE). These algorithms will be used to compress different types of data, such as text files, images, or audio files, while ensuring no loss of information.

In addition to the compression functionality, the project will also involve the development of corresponding decompression algorithms. These decompressors will take compressed files as input and restore them to their original form using the inverse operations of the compression algorithms. This ensures that the project achieves the goal of lossless compression, enabling users to reliably restore their compressed files.

Throughout the project, special attention will be given to the efficiency and effectiveness of the compression algorithms implemented. The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated based on factors such as compression ratio, execution time, and memory usage. This evaluation will help determine the effectiveness and suitability of each algorithm for different types of data.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the project, a video presentation will be created, offering a live tour of the implemented compressor and decompressor. The video will provide an overview of the compression techniques used, along with a demonstration of how the project effectively compresses and decompresses data. This will allow viewers to grasp the concepts behind compression and understand the benefits it offers.

By completing the "Compressor and Decompressor" project, you will gain a solid understanding of lossless compression techniques and their implementation using Java. You will also become proficient in evaluating the efficiency of different compression algorithms. This project will enhance your programming skills, expand your knowledge of data compression, and enable you to contribute to the development of efficient file compression solutions.
